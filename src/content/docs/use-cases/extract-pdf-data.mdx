title: Extract Data from PDFs
description: Pull invoice data, contract deliverables, and more into spreadsheets.
---

You have 50 PDF invoices. You need the amounts, dates, and vendor names in a spreadsheet. Doing this manually takes hours. Ishi does it in minutes.

---

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:

- 📄 Extract structured data from PDFs
- 📊 Export to CSV, Excel, or directly to apps like Notion/Airtable
- 🔍 Parse contracts for key terms and deliverables
- ✅ Verify extracted data before committing

---

## Step 1: Point Ishi to Your PDFs

Open Ishi and describe what you need:

```
I have 50 invoices in my Documents/Invoices folder.
Extract the vendor name, invoice number, date, and total amount from each.
Export to a CSV file.
```

Ishi will read your request and ask any clarifying questions.

---

## Step 2: Preview the Extraction

Before processing all files, Ishi shows a **sample extraction**:

```
📄 Sample: Acme-Corp-Invoice-001.pdf
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Extracted Fields:
┌─────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ Vendor      │ Acme Corporation        │
│ Invoice #   │ INV-2025-0042           │
│ Date        │ 2025-01-02              │
│ Amount      │ $1,250.00               │
│ Due Date    │ 2025-02-01              │
└─────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

Does this look correct? [Yes, proceed with all] [Adjust fields] [Cancel]
```

This preview ensures Ishi understood your document structure correctly.

---

## Step 3: Process All Files

Once you approve the sample, Ishi processes all PDFs:

```
Processing invoices...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ 48/50 extracted successfully
⚠️ 2 need review (unclear vendor name)

[Review flagged items] [Download CSV]
```

Files that couldn't be parsed confidently are flagged for manual review—Ishi never guesses.

---

## Step 4: Review & Export

Ishi shows you the complete dataset before creating any files:

| Vendor    | Invoice #     | Date       | Amount    |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Acme Corp | INV-2025-0042 | 2025-01-02 | $1,250.00 |
| Beta LLC  | INV-8821      | 2025-01-03 | $840.00   |
| ...       | ...           | ...        | ...       |

Then choose your export format:

- **CSV** — Universal spreadsheet format
- **Excel (.xlsx)** — With formatting
- **Direct to Notion** — Via MCP integration
- **Direct to Airtable** — Via MCP integration

## Example Use Cases

### Invoices

```
Extract vendor, invoice number, date, amount, and due date
from all PDFs in Downloads/Invoices
```

### Contracts

```
Read this contract and create a list of all deliverables,
deadlines, and payment milestones
```

### Receipts

```
Parse these expense receipts and create an expense report
with categories, dates, and amounts
```

### Statements

```
Extract all transactions from this bank statement PDF
and export to Excel
```

---

## Working with Scanned PDFs

For scanned documents (images, not text), Ishi uses OCR:

```
These are scanned invoices. Use OCR to extract the text first,
then parse the vendor and amounts.
```

Scanned documents take longer but work with the same workflow.

---

## Connecting to Cloud Apps

Want data to go directly to Notion, Airtable, or Google Sheets?

1. Set up the [MCP integration](/docs/advanced/integrations) for your app
2. Ask Ishi to export directly:

```
Extract invoice data and add each row to my Airtable "Invoices" table
```

---

## Safety Features

### Preview Before Commit

Every extraction is previewed before any files are created.

### No Guessing

If Ishi can't confidently parse a field, it flags it for review.

### Local Processing

Your PDFs never leave your computer. Extraction happens locally.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about field names** — "Extract 'Total Due' not 'Subtotal'"
2. **Provide a sample** — "The vendor name is usually in the top-left header"
3. **Start with one file** — Test the extraction before running on hundreds
