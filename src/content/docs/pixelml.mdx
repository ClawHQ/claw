## The Pioneer: Ishi Intent Engine v1.0

Our flagship model, **Ishi Intent Engine**, is the implementation of the [Semantic Router](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655) research paper. It intelligently routes your requests to the most cost-effective model while maintaining quality.

### How It Works

Instead of always using the most expensive model:

1. **Ishi analyzes your prompt** — Understands the complexity of your request
2. **Routes to optimal model** — Simple tasks use cheaper models, complex tasks use premium ones
3. **You save money** — Pay for what you need, not what you don't

### Cost Savings Example

| Task                        | Traditional (GPT-4) | With Ishi | Savings           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| "Rename this file"          | $0.03               | $0.001    | 97%               |
| "Write a basic email"       | $0.05               | $0.003    | 94%               |
| "Analyze this complex code" | $0.08               | $0.08     | 0% (uses premium) |

Ishi is smart—it uses premium models only when the task requires it.

## API Endpoint

All requests go through our OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```
https://ishi.pixelml.com/v1/chat/completions
```

The API follows the OpenAI specification, so existing tools work out of the box.

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://ishi.pixelml.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "semantic-routed-model",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```
