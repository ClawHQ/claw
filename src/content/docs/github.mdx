description: Use Ishi in GitHub issues and pull-requests.
---

Ishi integrates with your GitHub workflow. Mention `/claw` or `/oc` in your comment, and Ishi will execute tasks within your GitHub Actions runner.

---

## Features

- **Triage issues**: Ask Ishi to look into an issue and explain it to you.
- **Fix and implement**: Ask Ishi to fix an issue or implement a feature. And it will work in a new branch and submits a PR with all the changes.
- **Secure**: Ishi runs inside your GitHub's runners.

---

## Installation

Run the following command in a project that is in a GitHub repo:

```bash
ishi github install
```

This will walk you through installing the GitHub app, creating the workflow, and setting up secrets.

---

### Manual Setup

Or you can set it up manually.

1. **Install the GitHub app**

   Head over to [**github.com/apps/claw-agent**](https://github.com/apps/claw-agent). Make sure it's installed on the target repository.

2. **Add the workflow**

   Add the following workflow file to `.github/workflows/claw.yml` in your repo. Make sure to set the appropriate `model` and required API keys in `env`.

   ```yml title=".github/workflows/claw.yml" {24,26}
   name: claw

   on:
     issue_comment:
       types: [created]
     pull_request_review_comment:
       types: [created]

   jobs:
     claw:
       if: |
         contains(github.event.comment.body, '/oc') ||
         contains(github.event.comment.body, '/ishi')
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         id-token: write
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             fetch-depth: 1

         - name: Run Ishi
           uses: PixelML/ishi/github@latest
           env:
             ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
           with:
             model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
             # share: true
             # github_token: xxxx
   ```

3. **Store the API keys in secrets**

   In your organization or project **settings**, expand **Secrets and variables** on the left and select **Actions**. And add the required API keys.

---

## Configuration

- `model`: The model to use with Ishi. Takes the format of `provider/model`. This is **required**.
- `agent`: The agent to use. Must be a primary agent. Falls back to `default_agent` from config or `"build"` if not found.
- `share`: Whether to share the Ishi session. Defaults to **true** for public repositories.
- `prompt`: Optional custom prompt to override the default behavior. Use this to customize how Ishi processes requests.
- `token`: Optional GitHub access token for performing operations such as creating comments, committing changes, and opening pull requests. By default, Ishi uses the installation access token from the Ishi GitHub App, so commits, comments, and pull requests appear as coming from the app.

  Alternatively, you can use the GitHub Action runner's [built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token) without installing the Ishi GitHub App. Just make sure to grant the required permissions in your workflow:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
    issues: write
  ```

  You can also use a [personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)(PAT) if preferred.

## Supported Events

Ishi can be triggered by the following GitHub events:

| Event Type                    | Triggered By                           | Details                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `issue_comment`               | Comment on an issue or PR              | Mention `/claw` or `/oc` in your comment. Ishi reads the issue/PR context and can create branches, open PRs, or reply with explanations.                    |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | Comment on specific code lines in a PR | Mention `/claw` or `/oc` while reviewing code. Ishi receives file path, line numbers, and diff context for precise responses.                               |
| `schedule`                    | Cron-based schedule                    | Run Ishi on a schedule using the `prompt` input. Useful for automated code reviews, reports, or maintenance tasks. Ishi can create issues or PRs as needed. |
| `pull_request`                | PR opened or updated                   | Automatically trigger Ishi when PRs are opened, synchronized, or reopened. Useful for automated reviews without needing to leave a comment.                 |

### Schedule Example

Run Ishi on a schedule to perform automated tasks:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/claw-scheduled.yml"
name: Scheduled Ishi Task

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Every Monday at 9am UTC

jobs:
  claw:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Ishi
        uses: PixelML/ishi/github@latest
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        with:
          model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
          prompt: |
            Review the codebase for any TODO comments and create a summary.
            If you find issues worth addressing, open an issue to track them.
```

For scheduled events, the `prompt` input is **required** since there's no comment to extract instructions from.

> **Note:** Scheduled workflows run without a user context to permission-check, so the workflow must grant `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` if you expect Ishi to create branches or PRs during a scheduled run.

---

### Pull Request Example

Automatically review PRs when they are opened or updated:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/claw-review.yml"
name: claw-review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
      pull-requests: read
      issues: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: PixelML/ishi/github@latest
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        with:
          model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
          prompt: |
            Review this pull request:
            - Check for code quality issues
            - Look for potential bugs
            - Suggest improvements
```

For `pull_request` events, if no `prompt` is provided, Ishi defaults to reviewing the pull request.

---

## Custom prompts

Override the default prompt to customize Ishi's behavior for your workflow.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/claw.yml"
- uses: PixelML/ishi/github@latest
  with:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    prompt: |
      Review this pull request:
      - Check for code quality issues
      - Look for potential bugs
      - Suggest improvements
```

This is useful for enforcing specific review criteria, coding standards, or focus areas relevant to your project.

---

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use Ishi in GitHub.

- **Explain an issue**

  Add this comment in a GitHub issue.

  ```
  /claw explain this issue
  ```

  Ishi will read the entire thread, including all comments, and reply with a clear explanation.

- **Fix an issue**

  In a GitHub issue, say:

  ```
  /claw fix this
  ```

  And Ishi will create a new branch, implement the changes, and open a PR with the changes.

- **Review PRs and make changes**

  Leave the following comment on a GitHub PR.

  ```
  Delete the attachment from S3 when the note is removed /oc
  ```

  Ishi will implement the requested change and commit it to the same PR.

- **Review specific code lines**

  Leave a comment directly on code lines in the PR's "Files" tab. Ishi automatically detects the file, line numbers, and diff context to provide precise responses.

  ```
  [Comment on specific lines in Files tab]
  /oc add error handling here
  ```

  When commenting on specific lines, Ishi receives:
  - The exact file being reviewed
  - The specific lines of code
  - The surrounding diff context
  - Line number information

  This allows for more targeted requests without needing to specify file paths or line numbers manually.
