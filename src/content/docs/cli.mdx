import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

The Ishi CLI by default starts the [TUI](/docs/tui) when run without any arguments.

```bash
ishi
```

But it also accepts commands as documented on this page. This allows you to interact with Ishi programmatically.

```bash
ishi run "Explain how closures work in JavaScript"
```

---

### tui

Start the Ishi terminal user interface.

```bash
claw [project]
```

---

## Commands

The Ishi CLI also has the following commands.

---

### agent

Manage agents for Ishi.

```bash
ishi agent [command]
```

---

#### create

Create a new agent with custom configuration.

```bash
ishi agent create
```

This command will guide you through creating a new agent with a custom system prompt and tool configuration.

---

### auth

Command to manage credentials and login for providers.

```bash
ishi auth [command]
```

---

#### login

Ishi is powered by the provider list at [Models.dev](https://models.dev), so you can use `ishi auth login` to configure API keys for any provider you'd like to use. This is stored in `~/.local/share/ishi/auth.json`.

```bash
ishi auth login
```

When Ishi starts up it loads the providers from the credentials file. And if there are any keys defined in your environments or a `.env` file in your project.

---

#### list

Lists all the authenticated providers as stored in the credentials file.

```bash
ishi auth list
```

Or the short version.

```bash
ishi auth ls
```

---

#### logout

Logs you out of a provider by clearing it from the credentials file.

```bash
ishi auth logout
```

---

### github

Manage the GitHub agent for repository automation.

```bash
ishi github [command]
```

---

#### install

Install the GitHub agent in your repository.

```bash
ishi github install
```

This sets up the necessary GitHub Actions workflow and guides you through the configuration process. [Learn more](/docs/github).

---

#### run

Run the GitHub agent. This is typically used in GitHub Actions.

```bash
ishi github run
```

##### Flags

| Flag      | Description                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `--event` | GitHub mock event to run the agent for |
| `--token` | GitHub personal access token           |

---

### models

List all available models from configured providers.

```bash
ishi models [provider]
```

This command displays all models available across your configured providers in the format `provider/model`.

This is useful for figuring out the exact model name to use in [your config](/docs/config/).

You can optionally pass a provider ID to filter models by that provider.

```bash
ishi models anthropic
```

#### Flags

| Flag        | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--refresh` | Refresh the models cache from models.dev                     |
| `--verbose` | Use more verbose model output (includes metadata like costs) |

Use the `--refresh` flag to update the cached model list. This is useful when new models have been added to a provider and you want to see them in Ishi.

```bash
ishi models --refresh
```

---

### run

Run ishi in non-interactive mode by passing a prompt directly.

```bash
ishi run [message..]
```

This is useful for scripting, automation, or when you want a quick answer without launching the full TUI. For example.

```bash "ishi run"
ishi run Explain the use of context in Go
```

You can also attach to a running `ishi serve` instance to avoid MCP server cold boot times on every run:

```bash
# Start a headless server in one terminal
ishi serve

# In another terminal, run commands that attach to it
ishi run --attach http://localhost:4096 "Explain async/await in JavaScript"
```
