description: Control what Ishi can do and when it needs your approval.

Ishi is designed around the **Glass Box** philosophy: you see everything, you control everything. This page explains how to set your comfort level with Ishi's autonomy.

## The Safety Slider

Think of permissions like trust levels with a new employee:

| Level | Name      | How It Works                                              |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢    | **Allow** | Ishi handles it automatically—no approval needed          |
| 🟡    | **Ask**   | Ishi shows you what it wants to do and waits for approval |
| 🔴    | **Deny**  | Ishi can't do this action at all                          |

By default, Ishi asks for approval on sensitive operations. As you build trust, you can grant more autonomy.

## What You Can Control

### File Editing

Control whether Ishi can modify your files:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "permission": {
    "edit": "ask"
  }
}
```

- **Allow**: Ishi edits files without asking
- **Ask**: Ishi shows the changes and waits for your "OK" (recommended to start)
- **Deny**: Ishi can only suggest edits, not make them

---

### Running Commands

Control whether Ishi can run commands on your system:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "permission": {
    "bash": "ask"
  }
}
```

You can also set rules for specific commands:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "permission": {
    "bash": {
      "open *": "allow",
      "mv *": "ask",
      "rm *": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

This example:

- ✅ **Allows** opening files and apps
- 🟡 **Asks** before moving files
- 🔴 **Blocks** file deletion entirely

---

### Web Access

Control whether Ishi can fetch information from the web:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "permission": {
    "webfetch": "ask"
  }
}
```

---

### Files Outside Your Folder

By default, Ishi asks before touching files outside your current project folder:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": "ask"
  }
}
```

This prevents accidental changes to files you didn't intend to work with.

---

## Quick Setup: Conservative Start

New to Ishi? Start with this "ask for everything" configuration:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "permission": {
    "edit": "ask",
    "bash": "ask",
    "webfetch": "ask",
    "external_directory": "ask"
  }
}
```

As you get comfortable, you can loosen specific permissions.

---

## Quick Setup: Hands-Off Mode

Ready to let Ishi handle routine tasks? Try this:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "permission": {
    "edit": "allow",
    "bash": {
      "*": "allow",
      "rm *": "ask",
      "sudo *": "deny"
    },
    "external_directory": "ask"
  }
}
```

This allows most operations but:

- 🟡 Asks before deleting files
- 🔴 Blocks admin/system commands
- 🟡 Asks before touching files outside your project

---

## Session Approvals

When Ishi asks for permission during a session, you'll see three options:

1. **Accept** — Allow this one time
2. **Accept Always** — Allow this action for the rest of the session
3. **Deny** — Block this action

"Accept Always" is useful when Ishi needs to do the same thing repeatedly (like opening multiple files).

## Where to Put Your Settings

Save your permission settings in one of these locations:

| Location                   | Scope                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `~/.config/ishi/ishi.json` | All your projects (global) |
| `./ishi.json`              | This project only          |

Project settings override global settings, so you can have stricter rules for sensitive projects.

## Summary

| Permission           | What It Controls      | Recommended Start |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| `edit`               | Modifying files       | Ask               |
| `bash`               | Running commands      | Ask               |
| `webfetch`           | Accessing the web     | Ask               |
| `external_directory` | Files outside project | Ask               |

Start conservative, build trust, then adjust. That's the Glass Box way. 🔍
