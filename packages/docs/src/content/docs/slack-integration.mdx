description: Connect OpenClaw to Slack for conversational agent control.
---

OpenClaw integrates with Slack so you can chat with your agent from anywhere.

## How It Works

1. Add the OpenClaw Slack app to your workspace
2. Mention `@claw` in any channel to start a run
3. The agent responds in a thread with progress updates
4. Open Claw Desktop later to review and resume

## Setting Up Slack

### Create a Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com)
2. Create a new app with Bot Token Scopes:
   - `app_mentions:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `channels:history`
   - `groups:history`
3. Install to your workspace
4. Copy the Bot Token

### Configure OpenClaw

Add to your OpenClaw `.env`:
```
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
```

## Using Slack

```
@claw refactor the auth module
```

The agent will:
1. Acknowledge your request
2. Start working in a thread
3. Update you with progress
4. Ask for approval if needed (you can approve in Slack or Desktop)

## Claw Desktop Integration

Runs started from Slack show a Slack icon in Claw Desktop. Your `run_id` is consistent across both interfaces.
