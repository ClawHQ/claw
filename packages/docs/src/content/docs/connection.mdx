Connect Claw Desktop to your OpenClaw instance to start reviewing and resuming agent runs.

## Prerequisites

- An OpenClaw instance running and accessible
- Your OpenClaw API token

## Connection Setup

1. Open Claw Desktop
2. Enter your **Host URL** (e.g., `wss://your-server.com:8080`)
3. Enter your **API Token**
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify

Once connected, Claw Desktop will perform a V3 WebSocket handshake and receive a device token for persistent authentication.

## Multiple Hosts

You can add and manage multiple OpenClaw hosts. Switch between them from the connection dropdown in the sidebar.

## Troubleshooting

If connection fails:
- Ensure your OpenClaw instance is running
- Check that the Host URL is correct (include `wss://` for secure connections)
- Verify your API token hasn't expired
- Check network connectivity (firewall, VPN, etc.)
