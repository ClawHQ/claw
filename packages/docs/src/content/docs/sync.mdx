Claw Desktop continuously syncs with your OpenClaw instance to keep you up to date.

## How Sync Works

- **Polling** — App polls OpenClaw every 5 seconds for new events
- **Cursor-based** — Only fetches events after your last known cursor (incremental)
- **Reactive** — New events appear in the timeline without page refresh

## Sync Modes

### Global Inbox Sync
On app start, Claw Desktop syncs all run statuses in the background. This powers the "While You Were Away" feature.

### Per-Run Sync
When you open a run detail view, a focused sync fetches the full event history for that run.

## While You Were Away

When you reopen Claw Desktop, you'll see a summary of what changed since your last session:
- Runs that became blocked
- Runs that completed
- Runs that failed

Updates are sorted newest first, with blocked runs prioritized.

## File-System Storage

All synced data is stored locally in `~/Documents/ClawWorkspace/RUNS/<run_id>/`:
- `meta.json` — Run metadata and sync cursor
- `events.jsonl` — Append-only event log
- `ARTIFACTS/` — Downloaded artifacts
