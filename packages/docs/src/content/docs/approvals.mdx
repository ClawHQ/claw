title: Human-in-the-Loop Approvals
description: Approve or reject blocked agent actions.
---

When your OpenClaw agent encounters an action that requires approval, it pauses and waits for your decision in Claw Desktop.

## How It Works

1. Agent reaches a blocked action (e.g., destructive file operation, external API call)
2. Run status changes to **Blocked** (yellow)
3. You see the blocked action in the Run Timeline
4. Click **Approve** or **Reject** inline
5. Agent resumes automatically after your decision

## Approval Interface

Blocked actions appear as highlighted cards in the timeline showing:
- **Action Type** — What the agent wants to do
- **Parameters** — Details of the action
- **Context** — Why the agent wants to do this

## Approve/Reject

- **Approve** — Agent proceeds with the action
- **Reject** — Agent skips the action and may try an alternative

Your decision is sent to OpenClaw and the run continues immediately.

## Offline Behavior

When offline, approval buttons are disabled with a tooltip explaining you need to reconnect to take action.
