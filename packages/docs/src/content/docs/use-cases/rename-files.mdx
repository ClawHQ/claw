title: Rename Files Intelligently
description: Automatically rename files based on their content, dates, or patterns.
---

`IMG_4832.png`. `Document (1).docx`. `Untitled-23.pdf`.

Your files deserve better names. Ishi analyzes content and proposes intelligent renames.

---

## What You'll Accomplish

- 🏷️ Rename files based on their actual content
- 📅 Add dates to file names automatically
- 🔄 Apply consistent naming patterns across folders
- 👻 Preview all renames before they happen

---

## Step 1: Select Files to Rename

Open Ishi and describe what you need:

```
I have 100 screenshots in my Desktop folder.
Rename them based on what's shown in each image.
```

Or be more specific:

```
Rename all PDFs in Documents to include the document date
in the format: YYYY-MM-DD-OriginalName.pdf
```

---

## Step 2: Review the Proposals

Ishi shows you every proposed rename side-by-side:

```
📝 Proposed Renames
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Name              →  Proposed Name
──────────────────────────────────────────
IMG_4832.png              →  Dashboard-Analytics-Chart.png
Screenshot 2025-01-03.png →  Login-Page-Redesign-v2.png
Untitled.docx             →  Q4-Budget-Proposal.docx
scan001.pdf               →  2025-01-02-Acme-Invoice.pdf

[Approve All] [Review One-by-One] [Cancel]
```

---

## Step 3: Approve, Edit, or Skip

For each file, you can:

| Action             | What Happens             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| ✅ **Approve**     | Rename as proposed       |
| ✏️ **Edit**        | Modify the proposed name |
| ⏭️ **Skip**        | Leave unchanged          |
| ✅ **Approve All** | Accept all remaining     |

## Naming Patterns

### By Content (AI-Powered)

```
Rename screenshots based on what's visible in the image
```

_Uses AI vision to understand image content_

### By Date

```
Add the file creation date to all PDFs: YYYY-MM-DD-filename.pdf
```

### By Pattern

```
Rename invoice PDFs to: Vendor-InvoiceNumber-Date.pdf
```

### By Metadata

```
Rename photos using their EXIF date: 2025-01-03-IMG_4832.jpg
```

## Bulk Renaming Examples

| Goal        | What to Say                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Screenshots | "Rename screenshots based on their visual content"        |
| Invoices    | "Rename to Vendor-Amount-Date format"                     |
| Photos      | "Use photo date from metadata"                            |
| Documents   | "Add creation date prefix"                                |
| Clean up    | "Remove spaces and special characters from all filenames" |

## Safety: The Ghost File Preview

Before any file is renamed, you see a **Ghost Preview**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📄 Current: IMG_4832.png               │
│  👻 Proposed: Dashboard-Chart.png       │
│                                         │
│  The ghost file shows you exactly what  │
│  the new name will be before commit.    │
│                                         │
│  [Approve] [Edit Name] [Skip]           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Nothing changes until you approve.

## Undo Any Rename

Made a mistake? Every rename is logged:

1. Open **History** in Ishi
2. Find the rename operation
3. Click **Undo**

The file reverts to its original name instantly.

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with a test batch** — Try 5-10 files before processing hundreds
2. **Be specific about format** — "Use hyphens, no spaces, lowercase"
3. **Include examples** — "Like: Acme-INV001-2025-01-03.pdf"
