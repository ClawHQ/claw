title: Organize Downloads Automatically
description: Have Ishi watch your Downloads folder and intelligently sort files.
---

Your Downloads folder is chaos. PDFs from last year, screenshots named "IMG_4832.png", and invoices buried under random files. Let's fix that in 5 minutes.

---

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, Ishi will:

- 📂 Watch your Downloads folder for new files
- 🏷️ Rename files intelligently (e.g., `Scan001.pdf` → `2025-01-Invoice-Acme.pdf`)
- 📁 Sort files into organized folders by type and date
- 👻 Show you a preview before making any changes

---

## Step 1: Open a Conversation

Launch Ishi and start a new conversation. Type:

```
Watch my Downloads folder and organize files as they arrive
```

Ishi will ask a few clarifying questions:

- What types of files should I organize?
- How should I sort them (by date, by type, by vendor)?
- Should I rename files based on their content?

Answer naturally—Ishi understands plain English.

## Step 2: Review the Plan

Before touching any files, Ishi shows you a **plan preview**:

```
📋 Proposed Organization Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📂 Downloads/
├── 📁 Invoices/
│   ├── 2025-01/
│   └── 2024-12/
├── 📁 Screenshots/
├── 📁 Documents/
└── 📁 Other/

🔄 Proposed Renames:
• Scan001.pdf → Acme-Corp-Invoice-2025-01-03.pdf
• IMG_4832.png → Dashboard-Screenshot-2025-01-02.png
• doc(1).docx → Project-Proposal-Draft.docx

[Approve] [Modify] [Cancel]
```

This is the **Glass Box** philosophy in action—you see exactly what will happen.

---

## Step 3: See Ghost Files

Before any file is renamed or moved, Ishi shows you a **Ghost File Preview**:

| Current              | Proposed                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Scan001.pdf`        | `Acme-Corp-Invoice-2025-01-03.pdf`    |
| Location: Downloads/ | Location: Downloads/Invoices/2025-01/ |

The "ghost" file appears translucent until you approve. Nothing changes until you say so.

---

## Step 4: Approve or Reject

For each file, you can:

- ✅ **Approve** — Move and rename as proposed
- ✏️ **Edit** — Modify the proposed name or location
- ❌ **Skip** — Leave this file alone
- ✅ **Approve All** — Accept all remaining proposals

---

## Step 5: Set Up Auto-Organize (Optional)

Want Ishi to do this automatically going forward? Ask:

```
From now on, automatically organize new downloads using this pattern
```

Ishi will create a **watcher** that:

- Monitors your Downloads folder
- Proposes organization for new files
- Notifies you with a summary (you still approve batches)

---

## Safety Features

### Nothing Happens Without Approval

Every file operation shows a preview first. You're always in control.

### Full Undo History

Made a mistake? Every action is logged. Go to **History** and undo any operation.

### Files Stay Local

Your files never leave your computer. Ishi processes everything locally.

## Example Prompts

Try these variations based on your preference:

| Goal               | What to Say                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sort by type       | "Organize downloads into folders by file type"          |
| Sort by date       | "Sort downloads by month and year"                      |
| Invoices only      | "Find all invoices in Downloads and organize by vendor" |
| Screenshots        | "Rename screenshots based on what's in the image"       |
| Aggressive cleanup | "Archive anything older than 30 days"                   |

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about your preferences** — "Sort invoices by vendor name, not by date"
2. **Start with a small batch** — Test with 10 files before running on everything
3. **Use the Safety Slider** — Start at "Ask for everything" until you're comfortable
