description: Using Claw Desktop when disconnected.
---

Claw Desktop gracefully degrades when you lose connection to your OpenClaw instance.

## Offline Detection

The app detects offline state when:
- WebSocket connection fails
- Connection times out
- Network becomes unavailable

## Offline Behavior

When offline:
- **"Offline" banner** appears at the top of the app
- **Cached runs** are displayed from local storage
- **Timeline events** show previously synced data
- **Approve/Reject buttons** are disabled

## What Still Works

Even offline, you can:
- Browse run history from cache
- Read message timelines
- View artifacts stored locally
- Review file diffs

## What Doesn't Work

When offline, you cannot:
- Approve or reject blocked actions
- Resume runs
- See new events from the agent
- Start new runs

## Reconnection

Claw Desktop automatically reconnects with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, up to 10s max). Once reconnected, sync resumes automatically.
