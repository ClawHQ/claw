title: Undo History
description: Every action is logged. Undo any change, anytime.
---

Made a mistake? Approved something you shouldn't have? No problem.

**Every file operation in Ishi is logged.** You can undo any change at any time.

---

## How It Works

### Automatic Transaction Log

Every time Ishi modifies, renames, or moves a file, it records:

- **What changed** — The exact operation performed
- **When** — Timestamp of the action
- **Before state** — What the file looked like before
- **After state** — What it became

This log is stored locally on your machine.

---

## Viewing Your History

### Open the History Panel

In Ishi, access your history through:

- The **History** tab in the sidebar
- Keyboard shortcut (customizable in [Settings](/docs/keybinds))

## Undoing an Operation

### Single File Undo

1. Find the operation in History
2. Click **Undo**
3. Confirm the revert

The file returns to its previous state instantly.

### Batch Undo

If you renamed 50 files and want to undo all of them:

1. Find the batch operation
2. Click **Undo All**
3. Confirm

All 50 files revert to their original names.

## What Can Be Undone

| Operation     | Undoable?  | What Happens                      |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| File rename   | ✅ Yes     | Original name restored            |
| File move     | ✅ Yes     | File returns to original location |
| File edit     | ✅ Yes     | Previous content restored         |
| File creation | ✅ Yes     | Created file is deleted           |
| File deletion | ⚠️ Limited | If sent to Trash, can be restored |

<aside type="caution">
  **Important:** If a file was permanently deleted (bypassing Trash), it cannot be recovered through Undo. This is why
  Ishi defaults to moving files to Trash rather than permanent deletion.
</aside>

## How Long Is History Kept?

By default, Ishi keeps your operation history for **30 days**.

To change this:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "history": {
    "retention_days": 90
  }
}
```
