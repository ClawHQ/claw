Other AI tools are "magic boxes"—you ask for something, and _something happens_. You cross your fingers and hope.

**Ishi is a Glass Box.** You see everything before it happens.

## What Are Ghost Files?

When Ishi proposes a change to your files, it shows a **Ghost File**—a translucent preview of what the result will look like.

```

The ghost shows you the **exact outcome** at **zero risk**.

---

## How It Works

### 1. You Make a Request

```
Rename all invoices to include the vendor name and date
```

### 2. Ishi Simulates the Changes

Ishi analyzes your files and calculates what would happen—but **doesn't execute anything yet**.

### 3. You See the Ghost Preview

Every file that would be affected shows:

- **Current state** — What exists now
- **Ghost state** — What it would become
- **The difference** — What's changing

### 4. You Approve or Reject

- ✅ **Approve** — The ghost becomes real
- ❌ **Reject** — Nothing happens, file untouched

---

## The Diff View

For file modifications (not just renames), you see a full diff:

```diff
  Contract between Acme Corp and Client

- Payment due: NET 30
+ Payment due: NET 15

  Deliverables:
- - Phase 1: Design (March 1)
+ - Phase 1: Design (February 15)
- - Phase 2: Development (April 1)
+ - Phase 2: Development (March 15)
```

Red lines show what's being removed. Green lines show what's being added.

## Why This Matters

<Aside type="tip" title='The Problem with "Magic" AI'>
  Most AI tools hide what they're doing. You type a command and hope for the best. Then you discover it renamed your
  important files incorrectly, or worse—deleted something.
</Aside>

Ishi's Glass Box approach means:

- **No surprises** — You see exactly what will happen
- **No accidents** — Nothing executes without your approval
- **No anxiety** — You're always in control

---

## Batch Previews

When working with many files, Ishi groups the previews:

```
📋 Batch Preview: 47 files to rename
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Sample changes:
• IMG_001.png → Dashboard-Chart.png
• IMG_002.png → Login-Screen.png
• IMG_003.png → Settings-Panel.png

[See All 47] [Approve All] [Review One-by-One]
```

You can review everything or trust the pattern after checking samples.

---

## Ghost Files + Undo

Even after you approve, every action is logged. If the result isn't what you expected:

1. Open **History**
2. Find the operation
3. Click **Undo**

The ghost becomes real, but you can always revert.
