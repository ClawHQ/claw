Ishi comes with built-in capabilities that let your AI assistant interact with your files and system. Think of these as the "skills" your Digital Employee has.

---

## Core Capabilities

Here's what Ishi can do out of the box:

| Capability      | What It Does              | Example                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 📖 **Read**     | View file contents        | "Show me what's in this PDF"        |
| ✏️ **Edit**     | Modify existing files     | "Update the date in this invoice"   |
| 📝 **Write**    | Create new files          | "Create a summary document"         |
| 🔍 **Search**   | Find content across files | "Find all mentions of 'Acme Corp'"  |
| 📂 **List**     | See what's in a folder    | "What files are in my Downloads?"   |
| 🌐 **Web**      | Fetch information online  | "Look up the current exchange rate" |
| ⚡ **Commands** | Run system commands       | "Open this file in Preview"         |

---

## Enabling & Disabling

All capabilities are **enabled by default**. You can turn specific ones off if needed:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "tools": {
    "bash": false,
    "webfetch": false
  }
}
```

This would prevent Ishi from running commands or accessing the web.

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "tools": {
    "grep": true,

```json title="ishi.json"

## Task Tracking

Ishi can maintain a to-do list while working on complex tasks:

```json title="ishi.json"
{
  "tools": {
    "todowrite": true,
    "todoread": true

}
```

This helps Ishi stay organized when you ask it to do multi-step operations like "organize all my Q4 invoices by vendor."
