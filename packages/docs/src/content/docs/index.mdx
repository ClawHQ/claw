## What Ishi Does

Your Digital Employee can handle the operational tasks that eat up your day:

### 📁 Smart File Organization

Tell Ishi to watch your Downloads folder. When files arrive, it proposes intelligent renames and organization:

- `Scan_001.pdf` → `2025-01-Invoice-Acme-Corp.pdf`
- `Screenshot 2025-01-03.png` → `Homepage-Redesign-Draft.png`

### 👻 Ghost Files (Preview Before Commit)

Ishi **never touches your files without approval**. Every proposed change shows a preview:

- **Before:** Current file/folder state
- **After:** What it will look like
- **Your choice:** Approve or reject

This is the "Glass Box" philosophy—you see everything before it happens.

### 🎚️ Safety Slider

Control how much autonomy Ishi has:

- **Level 1 (Intern):** "Ask me before doing anything"
- **Level 2 (Associate):** "Handle routine tasks, ask for important ones"
- **Level 3 (Partner):** "Just get it done and notify me"

### ↩️ Undo Everything

Made a mistake? Every action is logged. Undo any change with one click.

### ☁️ Cloud Bridge

Connect your local files to cloud workflows. Drag files onto AgenticFlow integrations to sync with 2,500+ apps like Notion, Airtable, and Google Sheets.
