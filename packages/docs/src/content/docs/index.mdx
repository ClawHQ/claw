**Claw Desktop** is the operator cockpit for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) agents. Your agent runs remotely—on DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, or your own server—working overnight while you chat via Slack. When you're back at your desk, open Claw Desktop to review what happened, check the diffs, and resume exactly where your agent left off.

## Why Claw Desktop?

Stop scrolling through Slack history to find what your agent did overnight. Claw Desktop gives you:

- **While-You-Were-Away Sync** — See exactly what changed since you last opened the app
- **Artifact Review** — Diffs, outputs, and verification checklists in one place
- **One-Click Resume** — Continue the same `run_id` across Slack and Desktop
- **Human-in-the-Loop Approvals** — Approve or reject blocked actions inline

## Connect to Your OpenClaw Instance

Claw Desktop connects to your OpenClaw instance via WebSocket. You'll need:

1. **Host URL** — Where your OpenClaw is running (e.g., `ws://your-server:8080`)
2. **API Token** — Your OpenClaw API token for authentication

### Setup Steps

1. Launch Claw Desktop
2. Enter your Host URL and API Token
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify
4. Save your connection settings

You can add multiple OpenClaw hosts and switch between them.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│   Your Slack    │◄────►│    OpenClaw      │◄────►│  Claw Desktop   │
│  (Chat while    │      │  (Runs 24/7 on   │      │  (Review when   │
│   you sleep)    │      │   your server)   │      │   you're back)  │
└─────────────────┘      └──────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Deploy OpenClaw** on DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, or your infrastructure
2. **Chat via Slack** to kick off runs and monitor progress
3. **Open Claw Desktop** to review artifacts, approve blocked actions, and resume

Your `run_id` stays consistent across all interfaces. Context is never lost.

## Architecture

Claw Desktop follows a 4-tier architecture:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         UI Layer                          │
│            (SolidJS Components + Reactive Stores)         │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                     Sync Engine                           │
│          (Cursor-based polling every 5 seconds)           │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                     Persistence                           │
│   (File-system: ~/Documents/ClawWorkspace/RUNS/<id>/)     │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                   OpenClaw Adapter                        │
│           (WebSocket V3 Protocol Translation)             │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### File-System Persistence

All run data is stored locally in `~/Documents/ClawWorkspace/`:

```
ClawWorkspace/
└── RUNS/
    └── <run_id>/
        ├── meta.json       # Run metadata
        ├── events.jsonl    # Append-only event log
        └── ARTIFACTS/      # Downloaded artifacts
```

You can browse this workspace in Finder without the app.
