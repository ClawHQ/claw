Claw Desktop provides a dedicated panel for reviewing artifacts your agent created during a run.

## Artifact Panel

The right panel in Run Detail view shows three tabs:

### Plan
The agent's plan for the task (PLAN.md). Shows what the agent intends to do before starting work.

### Summary
What the agent accomplished (SUMMARY.md). Updated as the agent completes steps.

### Verify
Verification checklist (VERIFICATION.md). A list of items to check to confirm the work is correct.

## File Diffs

In the timeline, file changes appear as diff cards with:
- **File path** — Which file was modified
- **Syntax highlighting** — Language-aware diff rendering
- **Expand/Collapse** — Click to see full diff content

## Local Storage

All artifacts are saved to your local workspace at:
```
~/Documents/ClawWorkspace/RUNS/<run_id>/ARTIFACTS/
```

You can browse these files in Finder even when Claw Desktop isn't running.
